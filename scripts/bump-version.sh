# Bump every version surface, then PROVE none was missed.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/bump-version.sh <version> [--commit] [--tag] [--skip-tests]
#
#   --commit      also `git add` the version surfaces and commit them
#   --tag         also create the vX.Y.Z tag (implies --commit)
#   --skip-tests  don't run the suite for the README "tests passing" badge
#
# By DEFAULT this script only edits files. It does not touch git.
#
# Why: the previous version ran `git add -A && git commit && git tag`
# unconditionally, which swept whatever else was in the working tree into the
# bump commit. That breaks the QA-BEFORE-BUMP rule — content fixes are supposed
# to be committed (and QA'd) first, with the bump as its own final commit — and
# on the v0.8.5 release it silently squashed ten unrelated fixes into
# "chore: bump to v0.8.5".
#
# The other historical failure was a staleness check that only verified the
# surfaces the script already knew about, which is self-fulfilling: it cannot
# discover a surface nobody wired in. v0.8.5 shipped with package-lock.json and
# src/mcp-server.ts still on the old version while the script printed a green
# summary. The check below now sweeps the repo for the OLD version instead, so
# an unknown surface fails the run rather than passing silently.
