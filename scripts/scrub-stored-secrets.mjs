/**
 * LAQ-SEC-005 — surgically replace known secret literals already stored in the
 * graph with the standard redaction placeholder.
 *
 * The ingestion-time redaction (src/engine/redact.ts) prevents NEW storage,
 * but anything captured before a pattern existed persists in turn/memory/
 * concept/monologue rows and every backup taken afterwards. This tool fixes
 * the stored copies:
 *
 *   - Literals are read from STDIN, one per line — never argv (world-readable
 *     via /proc) and never env echoes. e.g.:
 *       jq -r .pass ~/.sould/surreal-cred.json | node scripts/scrub-stored-secrets.mjs
 *   - Replacement only — no row is deleted; each match becomes
 *     "[redacted-secret-pattern]" via string::replace with the literal BOUND
 *     (never interpolated).
 *   - Per-table before/after match counts are printed as receipts. The
 *     literals themselves are never printed.
 *
 * Caveat: a scrubbed row keeps its original embedding (computed before the
 * scrub). Embeddings are not reversible to the literal, so this is accepted;
 * re-embedding is available via the repair scripts if ever desired.
 *
 * Credentials resolve like every other script: env > managed cred file >
 * legacy default (scripts/surreal-cred.mjs).
