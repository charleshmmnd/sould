# platform + arch, then execs the matching SEA binary that ships with the

# the SEA binary contains the Node runtime, so once Claude Code copies the
# plugin files in, no further user setup is needed.

# sould-mcp-darwin-arm64). The matching sould-daemon-<os>-<arch> is
# spawned by mcp-client when the daemon isn't already running.
