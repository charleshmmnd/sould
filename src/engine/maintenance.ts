 * On a degraded boot (store down) the guard is NOT latched: a deduped 5-min

 *
 * Restores the five jobs that used to live in LaqrumBrain's
 * ContextEngine.bootstrap(), which the OpenClaw framework called on session
 * lifecycle. Sould has no such framework call, so these had been silently
 * not running since the port. See GitHub issue history around 2026-04-21 —

 *
 * Each job is internally bounded (count<=200/2000/50 safety floors, LIMIT 50
 * on destructive operations) and idempotent. The ACAN retrain carries its own

 *
 * Fix: scale the LIMIT to the live unembedded backlog for THIS table. Small
 * backlog → small batch (no wasted embed calls, no cycle bloat). Large backlog
 * → large batch so it drains in hours/days, bounded by ADAPTIVE_MAX so a single
 * cycle never embeds an unbounded slug that would block the 6h cycle (the

 * each pass until the gap closes, so convergence is hours-to-days not months.

/** embedding_cache retention. embedding_cache is TELEMETRY (not a content
 *  table), so hard-delete IS allowed — but per the tag-don't-delete directive
 *  the writer at embeddings.ts l2Get filters `pruned_at IS NONE`, so we soft-tag
 *  here instead and let lane D's l2Put reset the tag if a hash is re-cached.
 *
 *  K17-maint: drains to a TARGET retention rather than tagging one 500-row batch
 *  per boot. Pre-fix this ran once at boot and capped at a single 500-row batch,
 *  so on a host that accrued >500 stale rows between restarts the cache grew
 *  without bound (and a long-lived daemon that never restarts never re-ran it at
 *  all). Now: (1) loop batches until no stale rows remain (bounded by
 *  MAX_BATCHES so a clock skew / mis-set pruned_at can't spin forever), and
 *  (2) the caller arms it on the same 6h interval as runEmbeddingBackfills so a
 *  daemon that stays up for weeks keeps draining.
 *
 *  G10B (2026-06-21): the soft-tag phase above only EVER sets pruned_at — under
 *  the old never-delete rule pruned rows accumulated forever (16.3k of 29.7k on
 *  the dev graph). embedding_cache is TELEMETRY, NOT a content table (D4 lists
 *  it as "DELETE OK"; gc.ts GC_CONTENT_TABLES does not include it), so it needs
 *  no keystone/GATED-GC marker — a plain `DELETE embedding_cache WHERE ...` is
 *  lint-legal. A pruned row is truly dead: l2Get (embeddings.ts:120) filters
 *  `pruned_at IS NONE` so it is never read, and l2Put's UPSERT recomputes the
 *  embedding on a cache miss (embeddings.ts:145 SETs embedding=$vec), so a
 *  re-cached hash gains nothing from a resurrected row over a fresh insert —
 *  hard-deleting a pruned row loses nothing. So after soft-tagging we HARD-DELETE
 *  already-pruned rows in the SAME bounded loop shape (LET+FOR+LIMIT+MAX_BATCHES)
 *  so a huge backlog can't spin forever. Idempotent + store-guarded like the
 *  soft-tag phase. */
