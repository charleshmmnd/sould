/**
 * G1 KEYSTONE — the single audited content-DELETE choke point.
 *
 * DELETION POLICY (core_memory:hoj8fvmbt7d14mskciba): hard-deleting graph
 * CONTENT is permitted ONLY through this QA-gated primitive — never
 * blind/ad-hoc. Every content DELETE in the codebase MUST flow through
 * gcHardDelete; the D4 lint (test/lint-no-delete-content-tables.test.ts)
 * fails CI on any `DELETE <content_table>` outside this file, and only
 * permits the sites here because each carries a `// GATED-GC:` marker.
 *
 * The five QA-gate primitives (all REAL — no stubs):
 *   (1) blast-radius      — co-delete EVERY incident edge across all 26
 *                           relation tables; NULL the COMPLETE set of scalar
 *                           back-pointers (4× superseded_by, resolved_by,
 *                           causal_chain trigger/outcome_memory, and the
 *                           *.memory_id refs) on surviving rows so nothing is
 *                           left dangling. after-verify re-checks every one.
 *   (2) genuinely-dead    — caller supplies the dead-set; this helper
 *                           additionally REFUSES to delete a correction
 *                           memory (defense in depth — a correction is
 *                           never garbage).
 *   (3) reversible        — per-batch in-process SELECT-and-write snapshot
 *                           of the target rows AND all incident edges to a
 *                           timestamped re-importable file under
 *                           <cacheDir>/gc-backups/. (The master full-DB
 *                           export is the separate disaster net.)
 *   (4) after-verify      — throw (and DO NOT claim success) unless: targets
 *                           are gone, NO surviving edge has in/out ∈ ids,
 *                           and no surviving row has superseded_by ∈ ids.
 *   (5) audit trail       — a maintenance_runs row records the op.
 *
 * BINDING NOTE (load-bearing — verified against surreal.ts:1468 +
 * what-is-missing.ts:123): this SurrealDB engine silently NO-OPs
 * `WHERE id IN $list` when $list is a string array — it treats the strings
 * as literals, not record references. The established idiom (bumpAccessCounts,
 * fetchAccessDeltas) is to VALIDATE each id with RECORD_ID_RE and then
 * DIRECTLY INTERPOLATE the canonical `table:key` tokens as a Thing list
 * (`IN [concept:a, concept:b]`). We do the same — every interpolated token is
 * RECORD_ID_RE-validated first, so interpolation is injection-safe.
 *
 * CARDINAL: this primitive is the ONLY place a content DELETE may live. Do
 * not loosen the D4 regex to permit DELETEs elsewhere — that re-opens the
 * 2026-04-06 silent-data-loss class (LaqrumBrain fork commit 5b93d73 destroyed
 * user memory for ~6 weeks). Add new gated sites here with a `// GATED-GC:`
 * marker, never by blanket-whitelisting a file.

/**
 * H2 — gc-backups retention sweep.
 *
 * Every destructive keystone op (gcHardDelete + gcSweepOrphanedEdges) writes a
 * timestamped `.surql` snapshot under <cacheDir>/gc-backups/ for reversibility.
 * The 6h maintenance cycle's monologue/turn_archive purges fire up to 100
 * batches each, and each batch is one snapshot — so on a long-lived single-host
 * install the directory accumulates FOREVER. Nothing pruned it before this.
 *
 * These snapshot files are BACKUP ARTIFACTS, NOT graph content (they are not a
 * content-table row and not swept by the orphaned-edge sweep), so pruning them
 * is a plain `unlinkSync` — it does NOT and MUST NOT route through the
 * gcHardDelete keystone (that is for content-table ROWS).
 *
 * Retention policy (keep the SMALLER of two windows, then a total-size cap):
 *   - COUNT cap: keep the newest {@link GC_BACKUP_KEEP_COUNT} (50) snapshots.
 *   - AGE cap:   keep snapshots newer than {@link GC_BACKUP_KEEP_DAYS} (30d).
 *   - SIZE cap:  if the surviving set still exceeds {@link GC_BACKUP_MAX_BYTES}
 *                (500MB), delete oldest-first until under it.
 * "Whichever is smaller" = a snapshot is a deletion CANDIDATE if it is BOTH
 * beyond the count window AND older than the age window is NOT required — we
 * delete a file if it fails EITHER the count test OR the age test (the union of
 * the two prune sets = the smaller surviving set). Then size trims further.
 *
 * SAFETY FLOOR (paramount — never destroy a just-made backup): a snapshot
 * younger than {@link GC_BACKUP_MIN_AGE_MS} (24h) is NEVER deleted, regardless
 * of count/size pressure. So the reversibility net for any recent destructive op
 * is always intact. (If a flood of recent deletes blows past the size cap inside
 * 24h, we let the dir exceed the cap rather than delete a fresh backup — disk is
 * cheaper than an un-restorable delete.)
 *
 * Returns the number of snapshot files deleted (so runJob records it as
 * rows_affected). Store-guard is NOT needed (pure filesystem) but we keep the
 * dir-missing case a clean 0. Errors per-file are swallowed; a single bad stat
 * never aborts the sweep.
