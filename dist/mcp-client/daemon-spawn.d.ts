 *   2. Probe PID file → if PID alive but socket dead, log warning, fall through
 *      to spawn (daemon was killed mid-life; pid file is stale).
 *   3. Spawn `node <daemon-binary>` detached + unref'd; wait for ready.
 *   4. Return socket path once daemon's meta.handshake responds.
 *
 * Uses a file lock at `<cacheDir>/daemon.lock` to prevent concurrent spawns
 * when multiple Claude Code sessions race on first daemon start.
