/**
 * JSON-RPC client used by sould-mcp to talk to sould-daemon.
 *
 * Connects to the daemon's Unix socket (linux/mac) or TCP loopback (Windows
 * / explicit override), sends typed RPC requests, and resolves promises with
 * results. Keeps connection state internally; exposes a small surface for
 * the MCP layer above.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *  - Each request gets a monotonic id. Responses are matched by id, so
 *    pipelined requests are fine and don't block each other.
 *  - On connection drop, in-flight requests reject with DAEMON_RESTARTING
 *    and the next request triggers a reconnect. Caller is responsible for
 *    deciding whether to retry (the MCP wrapper will, with backoff).
 *  - Line-delimited JSON over the socket — partial-read safe.
