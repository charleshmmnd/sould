/**
 * Auto-drain scheduler — restores the auto-extraction behavior that lived in
 * the in-process MemoryDaemon before commit 4f7b962 (2026-04-07) removed the
 * Anthropic SDK. Instead of the daemon making its own LLM calls, we shell
 * out to `claude --agent sould:memory-extractor -p "..."` which invokes
 * the existing subagent definition via the user's already-authenticated
 * Claude Code CLI.
 *
 * Triggers:
 *   - Daemon startup (one-shot if queue > threshold)
 *   - Periodic timer (default 5min)
 *   - SessionEnd hook (debounced)
 *
 * Safety:
 *   - PID-file lock at <cacheDir>/auto-drain.pid prevents overlapping spawns
 *   - Threshold gate prevents draining tiny queues
 *   - claude binary lookup with graceful fallback (logs warning, self-disables)
 *
 * Env-var overrides:
 *   SOULD_AUTO_DRAIN=0          → disable scheduler entirely
 *   SOULD_AUTO_DRAIN_THRESHOLD  → min queue size to trigger (default 5)
 *   SOULD_AUTO_DRAIN_INTERVAL_MS → periodic check cadence (default 300_000)
 *   SOULD_CLAUDE_BIN            → explicit path to claude binary
