/**
 * Atomically transition a pending_work row to a terminal status.
 *
 * The compound UNIQUE index pw_session_worktype_status_unique on
 * (session_id, work_type, status) means a naive UPDATE-to-terminal collides
 * when a sibling row already occupies the target triple. Canonical
 * pre-v0.7.75 symptom: fetch_pending_work returns "Database index
 * pw_session_worktype_status_unique already contains
 * [..., soul_evolve, completed]" when an early-exit UPDATE...SET
 * status="completed" runs against a row whose (session, work_type) already
 * has a completed sibling. Resolution: pre-check for a sibling row at
 * (session_id, work_type, target_status) excluding self. If one exists,
 * DELETE this row (the sibling is canonical). Otherwise UPDATE to terminal.
 *
 * Use this for every UPDATE-to-terminal call site (early-exits in
 * buildWorkPayload and the success/failure paths in handleCommitWorkResults).
 * The stale-recovery transaction in handleFetchPendingWork above uses the
 * same pattern for stuck-processing rows.
 *
 * R9: `guardToken` makes the terminal transition ownership-gated. The K15
 * `stillOwned` pre-check in handleCommitWorkResults is a snapshot taken BEFORE
 * a multi-minute commitResults; if the row is reclaimed by another drainer
 * DURING that window (its committing_token changes), an UNGUARDED
 * markTerminal(completed) would still stamp this row completed → the residual
 * C1 double-write. When guardToken is passed, the terminal UPDATE itself
 * carries `WHERE status="committing" AND committing_token=$guard`, so the
 * stamp lands ONLY if we still own the row at write time. Zero matched rows
 * means EITHER "reclaimed mid-write" (→ false, caller discards) OR "our own
 * withRetry re-fire already stamped it server-side" (S4) — disambiguated by a
 * confirmation SELECT for our own terminal state+token (mirrors K41
 * self-recognition): if the row is already in OUR terminal status with OUR
 * token, the earlier retried write succeeded → returns true. Callers that pass
 * NO guardToken (buildWorkPayload's self-complete early-exits, which act on a
 * row freshly claimed in "processing") keep the original unconditional
 * behavior. Returns true when the row was terminalized or archived by THIS
 * call, false only when a guardToken was supplied and no longer matched.
