/**
 * Workspace Migration — ingest OpenClaw's workspace files into SurrealDB.
 *
 * When a user switches from the default context engine to Sould, their
 * workspace may contain .md files, skill definitions, session transcripts,
 * and memory logs created by OpenClaw. This module:
 *
 *  1. Collects ONLY known OpenClaw workspace files (allowlist, not recursive)
 *  2. Scans skills/ and .agents/skills/ for SKILL.md → proper `skill` records
 *  3. Scans memory/ for daily logs → `memory` records
 *  4. Ingests identity/user/agent files as memories + artifacts
 *  5. Archives originals into .souldbrain-archive/ so the workspace is clean
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This module NEVER touches user project files. A user's README.md,
 * package.json, docs/, test fixtures, scripts, etc. are left completely alone.
 * We only collect files that OpenClaw's default context engine created.
 *
 * SOUL.md is deliberately left in place — it serves as a "nudge" during
 * soul graduation and is read at that time, not ingested.
 *
 * Cross-platform: uses path.join/path.sep throughout, no shell commands,
 * copyFile+unlink instead of rename (cross-filesystem safe).
