/**
 * Canonical edge vocabulary for the sould graph.
 *
 * Ad-hoc edge names fragment the graph — two concepts linked by
 * `applies_to_options` and `appliesToOptions` and `options_application`
 * can't easily be found together. This file defines the authoritative set
 * with stable names and brief semantics.
 *
 * Adding a new edge: extend the appropriate category, document the
 * semantics in one line, and update the SKILL.md vocabulary sections.
 * Prefer reusing an existing edge over inventing a new one.
 *
 * Not yet wired into relate() as a hard reject — for now this file is a
 * reference used by skills and documentation. A future phase should add
 * warn-on-unknown in relate() so drift is visible without being disruptive.
 *
 * The entries below match the actual edge tables in src/engine/schema.surql
 * plus the raw-SQL relations (`performed`, `owns`, `task_part_of`,
 * `session_task`) used by the structural pillars. Aspirational vocabulary
 * (`decomposes_into`, `elaborates`, ...) was retired in v0.7.74 because none
 * of those names were ever written via store.relate().
