 * Find the OS-user (UID) that owns the process LISTENING on a loopback TCP
 * `port`, using only the Linux `/proc` filesystem.
 *
 * --- Threat model (GH #13) ---
 * On a shared host, OS user B must never connect to OS user A's sould
 * memory graph. The schema fingerprint (isSouldSurreal) confirms a port
 * speaks "sould", but NOT *whose* sould it is. Without an owner check,
 * if user A and user B collided on the same managed port (or A left a DB on
 * the legacy 18765 that B probes), B would silently attach to A's SurrealDB
 * and read/write A's private memory. This helper lets the caller verify the
 * listener's UID == our UID before connecting, and skip otherwise.
 *
 * --- Algorithm (all reads relative to `procRoot`, default "/proc") ---
 *  1. Parse `/proc/net/tcp` (+ `/proc/net/tcp6`) for rows in LISTEN state
 *     (st == 0x0A) whose local address is loopback or wildcard on `port`.
 *     Collect the socket inode (column 9). Addresses are little-endian hex;
 *     we match 127.0.0.1 / 0.0.0.0 (v4) and ::1 / :: (v6) by comparing the
 *     decoded port and accepting loopback-or-wildcard host.
 *  2. For each `/proc/<pid>/fd/*` symlink, resolve the target. A socket fd
 *     points at `socket:[<inode>]`. The first PID owning one of our inodes is
 *     the listener.
 *  3. The owner UID is that pid directory's owner — `statSync(/proc/<pid>).uid`
 *     (kernel sets the dir owner to the process's real UID). We also fall back
 *     to the `Uid:` line of `/proc/<pid>/status` if stat is unavailable.
 *
 * Returns the owner UID, or `null` if it cannot be determined (no /proc, no
 * matching listener, permission denied scanning another user's fds, etc.).
 * `null` is "unknown", NOT "ours" — callers must decide conservatively.
 *
 * `procRoot` is injected so tests can point at a fixture tree instead of the
 * real kernel /proc (which can't be faked cross-platform / in CI).

 *    - UID determined and == getuid()  → safe to adopt.
 *    - UID undetermined (no /proc, EACCES, lsof missing):
 *        · managed/legacy-default ports (the UID-offset managed port + the
 *          legacy 18765 single-user default): CONSERVATIVE — skip unless we
 *          hold our own live SurrealDB pid file for it. These ports are the
 *          ones a colliding 2nd user is most likely to hit.
 *        · explicit external shared-infra ports (8000 / 8042): ALLOW (current
 *          behavior preserved). The user deliberately runs shared SurrealDB on
 *          those historical ports; the fingerprint + opt-in nature is the
 *          contract there.
 *  On non-POSIX (no getuid) the guard is skipped entirely: Windows users are
 *  isolated by separate accounts/sessions and loopback ACLs, not by this
 *  /proc-based check, so we keep the legacy allow behavior there.
