/**
 * Graph recovery helpers — extracted from introspect.ts migrate handlers
 * (v0.7.26 backfill_project_id, v0.7.32 backfill_derived_from with v0.7.38
 * daemon path + v0.7.39 placeholder synthesis) into a reusable module.
 *
 * Use these when:
 *   - Importing data from another sould/souldbrain instance whose session
 *     metadata didn't fully migrate (X-close pattern, gateway purges).
 *   - After a schema change that renders previously-written rows orphan
 *     (the v0.7.23 derived_from schema mismatch was the canonical case).
 *   - Periodic maintenance — they're idempotent so safe to run on a cron.
 *
 * Each helper is pure + deterministic (no LLM calls, no embedding writes;
 * it only reads existing embeddings and writes RELATE/UPDATE statements).
 * The full-recovery orchestrator runs them in dependency order so a single
 * call brings any orphan-state graph to canonical structure.
