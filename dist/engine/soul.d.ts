/**
 * Soul — the emergent identity document system.
 *
 * Unlike hardcoded identity chunks, the Soul document is written BY the agent
 * based on its own graph data. It lives in SurrealDB as `soul:souldbrain` and
 * evolves over time through experience-grounded revisions.
 *
 * Graduation is a staged process, not a binary gate. There are 8 gates total:
 * 7 volume thresholds + 1 quality gate (composite ≥ 0.85).
 *
 *   nascent    (0-4/8)  — Too early. Keep building experience.
 *   developing (5/8)    — Some signal. Diagnose weak areas, guide focus.
 *   emerging   (6/8)    — Volume is there. Quality gate becomes the blocker.
 *   maturing   (7/8)    — Either 6 volume + quality OR 7 volume - quality short.
 *   ready      (8/8)    — All 7 volume thresholds met AND quality ≥ 0.85.
 *
 * Quality is computed from actual performance signals: retrieval utilization,
 * skill success rates, reflection severity distribution, and tool failure rates.
 * An agent that meets all 7 volume thresholds but has terrible quality scores
 * will NOT graduate — it needs to improve before self-authoring makes sense.
 *
 * Ported from souldbrain — takes SurrealStore/EmbeddingService as params.

 *    concurrent drains could interleave and the last writer silently clobbered
 *    the first (per section). The WHERE guard here compares each written
 *    section against the exact value the caller read, so a concurrent write
 *    to any guarded section makes this UPDATE match nothing ("conflict") and
 *    the caller re-reads + re-merges. Guarding on section VALUES (all plain
 *    strings per schema.surql — adopted_at is TYPE string) sidesteps datetime
 *    equality entirely: the SDK returns `updated_at` as a nanosecond DateTime
 *    class (probed 2026-08-16 against the live instance; the old "ISO strings
 *    on the wire" note in SoulDocument predates this SDK), which is exactly
 *    the kind of representation trap a value guard avoids. Probe receipts:
 *    array-of-object equality via binding = true; key-order-insensitive =
 *    true; stale guard → UPDATE returns [].
 *
 *  - Per-section writes: N sections = N UPDATEs, each bumping updated_at and
 *    appending one revision — partial failures left the doc half-revised.
 *    One statement now writes all sections atomically.
 *
 * `revisions += $revs` appends server-side (probed: `+=` with an array
 * operand CONCATENATES), so a concurrent writer's revision entries are never
 * clobbered. The trim to SOUL_REVISIONS_CAP is a separate, lazy,
 * length-guarded UPDATE: it replaces the array only if its length still
 * equals what this write produced — any concurrent append skips the trim
 * (retried on a later revision; the audit trail is the only thing at stake).
 *
 * UPDATE on a missing soul:souldbrain is a no-op returning [] (probed), so a
 * soul deleted mid-flight surfaces as "conflict", never a resurrection.
