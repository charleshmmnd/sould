 *                           Only visible with SOULD_DEBUG=1.
 * - swallow.warn(ctx, e)  — WARN: unexpected but recoverable (DB query failure, compaction failure).
 *                           Always logged to stderr.
 * - swallow.error(ctx, e) — ERROR: something is genuinely broken (cleanup failure, schema failure).
 *                           Always logged to stderr with stack trace.
 *
 * Also exports `isUniqueViolation` — the single shared SurrealDB UNIQUE-index
 * rejection detector, reused by surreal.ts and the hook handlers that race
 * on UNIQUE-constrained CREATEs (subagent.correlation_key, artifact.path, etc).
 * One source of truth so the three detection layers (kind / name / message
 * regex) cannot drift between callers.

 *      surrealdb.d.ts). Matches both record-id and index UNIQUE violations
 *      at the wire level.

 *      (constructor.name on the prototype chain).
 *   3. message regex fallback — older driver versions / re-wrapped errors
 *      that lose the `kind` field. Matches the same message pattern that

 * `typeof v === "string"` gate rejected every real id and the rows
 * downstream were dropped by `.filter(r => r.id)`. This revision keeps
 * R7's original intent (reject numbers / booleans / NaN that would
 * otherwise stringify to truthy junk like "0" / "false" / "NaN") while
 * accepting RecordId-like objects whose `.toString()` returns the
 * canonical `"table:id"` form. Plain objects with no useful toString
 * stringify to "[object Object]" — those still return "" so an upstream
 * projection bug (e.g. accidentally pulling a whole row into an id
 * column) still gets dropped at this boundary instead of propagating.
