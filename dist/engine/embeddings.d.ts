 *  of the blanket HANDLER_ERROR — which is NON-retryable and would fail the
 *  user's turn outright. With a retryable code the mcp-client backs off and
 *  re-tries (the embedder is transiently underwater, not broken), absorbing the
 *  burst rather than surfacing it as a turn failure. `retryable` is a redundant
 *  boolean for any caller that prefers to duck-type the intent without coupling
