/**
 * Read-only local web UI server (GH #15, v1).
 *
 * The daemon's primary HTTP API (src/http-api.ts) listens on a Unix socket a
 * browser cannot reach, so the UI gets its own dedicated loopback TCP listener.
 * It serves the built Preact app at /ui and a small READ-ONLY JSON API at
 * /api/ui/* that wraps SurrealStore reads — it never mutates the graph and
 * never binds anything but 127.0.0.1.
 *
 * Auth reuses the same secret as the hook API (src/http-api.ts authToken),
 * presented by the browser as an HttpOnly cookie. The cookie is minted via a
 * SINGLE-USE, 60s nonce (`POST /ui/mint` with the Bearer master token →
 * /ui/auth?nonce=…), so the master token never appears in a URL, the opener's
 * argv, or browser history (LAQ-SEC-001).
 *
 * The server is inert until the frontend is built: if dist/ui/index.html is
 * absent it logs once and skips binding. Start is EADDRINUSE-tolerant so the
 * per-session mcp-client relay no-ops when the long-lived daemon already owns
 * the port.
