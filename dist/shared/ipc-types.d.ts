/**
 * IPC contract between sould-daemon and sould-mcp (the per-Claude-Code
 * client). This file is the single source of truth for what RPC methods
 * exist, what they accept, and what they return.
 *
 * Architecture (v0.7.0+):
 *   sould-mcp (thin client, one per Claude Code session)
 *     └── stdio  ── Claude Code (MCP protocol)
 *     └── socket ── sould-daemon (JSON-RPC over Unix socket / TCP)
 *
 * The daemon owns SurrealStore, EmbeddingService, ACAN weights, hook handlers,
 * and tool handlers. Clients are stateless relays that translate Claude Code's
 * MCP RPC into our IPC RPC. Multiple clients (multiple Claude Code sessions)
 * connect to one daemon; the daemon serializes per-session state via the
 * sessionId carried on every call.
 *
 * Wire format: JSON-RPC 2.0. Methods are namespaced — `tool.<name>` for MCP
 * tool handlers, `hook.<name>` for Claude Code hook events, `meta.<name>`
 * for daemon-level operations.
 *
 * Versioning: bump PROTOCOL_VERSION on any breaking change. The daemon
 * advertises its supported version in `meta.handshake`; clients refuse to
 * proceed against incompatible daemons (forces daemon restart with new
 * binary on plugin update).
