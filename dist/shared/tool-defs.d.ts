/**
 * MCP tool definitions — single source of truth for tool list returned via
 * ListToolsRequestSchema. Imported by both the legacy mcp-server.ts (which
 * runs handlers in-process) and the new mcp-client (which forwards calls
 * to the daemon over IPC).
 *
 * Schema is JSON Schema draft-07 compatible; matches the @modelcontextprotocol
 * SDK's expected shape. Adding a new tool requires three coordinated edits:
 *   1. Append to MCP_TOOLS below.
 *   2. Add the IPC method name to IPC_METHODS in shared/ipc-types.ts.
 *   3. Register a handler in src/daemon/index.ts (and a stub in mcp-server.ts
 *      while the legacy entry point still exists during the migration).
 *
 * Map between MCP tool name (snake_case) and IPC method (dotted camelCase) is
 * the MCP_TO_IPC_METHOD constant. The thin client uses it to translate tool
 * calls into JSON-RPC method names without case-converting at runtime.
