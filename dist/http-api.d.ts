 *      process fd table and take down the JSON-RPC listener + every session.
 *
 *  (2) a PERSISTENT 'error' handler for accept-time fd exhaustion
 *      (EMFILE/ENFILE). Node emits these on the SERVER (not a socket) when
 *      accept() fails for lack of fds; the default is to THROW, and an uncaught
 *      http.Server 'error' crashes the daemon (then crash-loops on respawn into
 *      the same starved state). Instead we pause accepting (server.close()) and
 *      schedule a re-listen once fds have had a chance to free — the same
 *      "degrade, don't crash" boundary as server.ts. Any OTHER steady-state
 *      error is logged and swallowed (never rethrown) so a transient listener
 *      hiccup can't crash the per-host singleton.
 *
 *  This handler is attached for the server's whole lifetime — distinct from the
 *  one-shot bind-error listener listen() uses to detect EADDRINUSE/bind failure
 *  (that one is removed the moment listen succeeds). Exported via __testing. */

 *  already timed out and called req.destroy(). req.destroy only closes the

 *  return {} (the same response the pre-extraction catch produced), keeping the
 *  user's turn unblocked — the known-good hook fail-open boundary. The deadline
 *  case is logged distinctly so ops can name "the loop was held and we cut it

 * The hook proxy routes to whichever per-PID socket has the newest mtime, so
 * older MCPs become unreachable after a Claude Code restart and just sit
 * holding memory until killed manually. Reaping closes that loop.
 *
 * SAFETY (round-2): before SIGTERMing a PID derived from the socket filename
 * we verify via /proc/<pid>/cmdline that it actually IS a sould MCP
 * process. PIDs can recycle quickly under load — a daemon restart could find

 * mirrors the cmdlineLooksLikeSouldDaemon pattern used in
