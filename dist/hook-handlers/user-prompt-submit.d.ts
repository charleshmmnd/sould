 * utilization because the model read it as ambient noise.
 *
 * 0.7.44: legend rewritten to align with Anthropic's documented prompt-
 * engineering guidance for Claude 4.5+:
 *  - "MUST" and "authoritative" softened — Anthropic explicitly warns these
 *    overtrigger on 4.5+ models.
 *  - Motivation-first: instruction frames the WHY (let the model decide
 *    relevance) rather than commanding compliance.
 *  - Quote-first grounding: ask for explicit reference-by-id when grounding,
 *    matching Anthropic's documented `<quotes>`-then-answer pattern.
 *
 * This is stage 2 of the v0.7.43-45 injection rework. Stages 3+ will move
 * the body itself to XML semantic tags and intent-gate the directive load. */
