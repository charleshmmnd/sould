/**
 * Regression tests for the auto-drain lock identity fixes (K10) in
 * src/daemon/auto-drain.ts.
 *
 *   K10b — releaseOnce must gate the unlink on the FULL lock identity
 *          (daemonPid AND child pid AND startedAt), not just daemonPid. A
 *          sibling drain from the SAME daemon writes a marker with the same
 *          daemonPid; the old loose check would unlink the sibling's LIVE lock
 *          when this (superseded) child exits, freeing the lock out from under
 *          a running drainer → two concurrent drainers.
 *
 *   K10a — writeChildMarker must surface the startedAt it stamps so the caller
 *          can record its full identity for that release-time check.
 *
 * The release closure is internal, but its decision is a pure comparison of
 * the recorded (daemonPid,pid,startedAt) against the on-disk marker. These
 * tests exercise that comparison through the __testing round-trip the way the
 * closure does (writeChildMarker -> readLockMarker), and would FAIL against the
 * old code where writeChildMarker returned void (no startedAt to compare) and a
 * daemonPid-only match treated a sibling's marker as "ours".
