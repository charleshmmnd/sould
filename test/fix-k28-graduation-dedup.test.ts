/**
 * K28 regression — detectAnomalies must compute the soul-graduation context
 * (hasSoul + checkGraduation, ~13 GROUP-ALL aggregations) ONCE per batch and
 * share it across BOTH graduation detectors, instead of each detector
 * recomputing it (the old code ran it ~2x on every UserPromptSubmit).
 *
 * Strategy: count the marker queries that hasSoul() and checkGraduation()
 * issue (`FROM soul:souldbrain`, `FROM session GROUP ALL`). With the fix each
 * fires exactly once per detectAnomalies() call. Before the fix they fired
 * twice (once per graduation detector). This is a pure mock test — it would
 * FAIL against the pre-fix code where the two detectors each imported soul.js
 * and called hasSoul/checkGraduation themselves.
