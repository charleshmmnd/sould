/**
 * K42 regression — createSoul() had a check-then-create TOCTOU on the fixed
 * `soul:souldbrain` id with no try/catch. If a concurrent caller (two
 * session-end pipelines, or a retry) slips between hasSoul() and the CREATE,
 * the second CREATE throws "already exists" and the whole call rejected.
 *
 * The fix wraps the CREATE in try/catch and treats already-exists as
 * idempotent presence (re-checking hasSoul() after the catch). These tests
 * use a mock store; the "throws then resolves" case FAILS against the
 * pre-fix code (the error propagated out of createSoul()).
 *
 * v0.8.8: createSoul returns a tri-state instead of a boolean. The old
 * boolean conflated "we authored the soul" with "we lost the race but it
 * exists" (both `true`), which let two concurrent soul_generate commits each
 * record a graduation_event — the double-celebration bug. "exists" now covers
 * both the up-front check and the race loss; only "created" means authorship.
