/**
 * Regression test for K12 (embed-queue half): EmbeddingService.embed() must
 * fast-fail past a bounded queue depth instead of pushing without limit.
 *
 * llama serializes embedding compute (one item at a time). The old embed()
 * pushed every request into embedQueue unconditionally — so a burst of hook
 * traffic, or a wedged/slow embedder, grew the FIFO without bound. Each entry
 * pins its text + two closures, making the queue the memory-leak surface on a
 * long-lived per-host daemon. The fix caps the queue and throws a clear,
 * retryable error past the ceiling.
 *
 * This stubs a never-resolving compute context so items stay queued, fills the
 * queue to the cap, and asserts the next embed() throws. Against the old code
 * the push was unbounded and no throw occurred.
